# Fast-Fourier-Transform-on-Network-on-Chip-Architectures-Project
====

Design a Network-on-Chip prototype for FFT, consist of routers and processing elements connected by communication links

Obtained SDF model to compute FFT, mapped each processes into PEs

Implemented codes for designed NoC prototype, FFT compute algorithm and test. Used SystemC simulation environment
