# Fast-Fourier-Transform-on-Network-on-Chip-Architectures-Project
====
Design a Network-on-Chip prototype for FFT, consist of routers and processing elements
connected by communication links
----

Obtained SDF model to compute FFT, mapped each processes into PEs
----

Implemented codes for designed NoC prototype, FFT compute algorithm and test. Used SystemC simulation environment
